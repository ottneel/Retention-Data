# Retention-Data

Another dataset from the PWC forsage virtual Intership
the company wants to know all about customers who have churned and how to reduce the churn rate.
Here are some of my findings:
1. Churn Rate sat at 26.5%
2. 64% of customers are not married
3. 83% lived on their own (No dependents)
4. 1,700 out of the 1869 churned customers were on a Month to Month contract
5. The More a customer had a Technical Ticket, the likelier such a customer was to churn. (those with 9 tickets had 100% churn rate)
6. Average Monthly charge for those who churned is $74.44

## Recommendation
1. Seems like the bulk of those churning are the youths (not married with no dependents) so therefore Management should come up with plans, incentives to keep the young ones
2. Customers on a Month to Month contract can be given incentives to get them to upgrade to higher plan so as to keep them
3. ways to reduce the amount of Technical tickets a customer files should be looked into to prevent customers from getting frustrated with having so much tech tickets. and this can be done by improving the services offered.
